            <p id="light">Divi is our flagship theme and visual page builder. It's the most widely used premium 
                WordPress theme in the world according to stats from BuiltWith.com. Divi is more than just a theme,
                it's a website building framework that makes it possible to design beautiful websites without ever
                touching a single line of code and without installing and configuring dozens of disjointed plugins.
                We think this is the future of WYSIWYG and it's unlike any WordPress theme you have ever used before.</p>
